## Driver Intersection Prediction ([Download](https://github.com/vlosing/retrospective_pseudo_labels/blob/main/driver_intention_prediction.csv))
The goal of here is to predict the driver's intent at intersections consisting of stopping, driving straight without stopping, or turning. It is based on the daily commute of fourteen subjects represented by a few ego-vehicle features such as the velocity, acceleration, distance to the intersection asf. This data set is described in detail in: Losing et al. "Personalized Maneuver Prediction at Intersections", ICRA 2017(). This data set was used in the experiments of the article.
